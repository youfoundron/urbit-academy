# Hoon Academy
I am tracking my progress as a student of the Fall '23 [Hoon Academy](https://docs.urbit.org/courses/urbit-academy/ha) cohort.

This repository will be used to show the work for answers to each lesson's homework questions.

Additionally I hope it may serve as a resource for current and future students trying to unblock themselves.

Special thanks to [~tamlut-modnys](https://github.com/tamlut-modnys) for all of the hard work put into the lessons.
