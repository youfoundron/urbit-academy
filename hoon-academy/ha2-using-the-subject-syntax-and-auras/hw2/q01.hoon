:: Q1. Mammal Tree I

:: We have a tree containing @t text representing mammals. However, it seems that a snake has snuck in there. We are going to fix that.

:: ['dog' ['snake' ['cat' 'mouse']]]

:: First, write an expression that uses the => (tisgar) rune to set this tree as the subject, and uses the . (dot) syntax to return it. Use only tall form.

:: If successful, the Dojo output should look like this:
:: ['dog' 'snake' 'cat' 'mouse']

:: Answer
=>  ['dog' 'snake' 'cat' 'mouse']  .
