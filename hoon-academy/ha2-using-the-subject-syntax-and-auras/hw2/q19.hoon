:: Q19. Desugaring II

:: I have a gate called mygate which takes an argument that is a triple. I call it like this:
:: (mygate a b c)

:: Desugar this to only use tall form.

:: Hint: it only takes one rune, a % (cen) rune, not %-

:: mygate doesn't exist so this won't run in the dojo

:: Answer
%^    mygate
    a
  b
c
