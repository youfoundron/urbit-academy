:: Q20. Desugaring III

:: I have a gate which takes a 5-tuple as an argument. I call it like this:

:: (biggate a b c d e)

:: Desugar this to only use tall form.

:: Hint: a % (cen) rune, not %- %+ or %^

:: biggate doesn't exist so this won't run in the Dojo

:: Answer
%:  biggate
  a
  b
  c
  d
  e
